And on a whim, I chose Panama City, Panama. Well… not really a “whim”. I research travel destinations like nobody’s business. It was a long cold winter and in March, I needed a warm weather vacation for the low. Panama City fit that bill perfectly. Also, I got a direct roundtrip flight from a nearby airport for $300 and stayed at very nice affordable luxury hotels for under $150 a night. Although I booked this trip relatively quickly for me (under a month), I still did a ton of research to make sure I felt completely comfortable. So here are the basics.<br></p><h2>Where I Stayed In Panama City, Panama</h2><p class=""><a href="https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/ptyar-ac-hotel-panama-city/overview/"><span>AC Marriot</span></a><br>I stayed here for one night for $95. The main selling point for me was the rooftop pool. I checked out a lot of Panama City rooftop pool pictures on Instagram and decided that I liked this view the best for the money. The room itself was clean and comfortable. I tend to go for more bougie, boutique hotels but for one night (or even your entire trip), this hotel is a solid choice.</p><p class=""><a href="https://www.tantalohotel.com/"><span>Tantalo</span></a><br>This hotel was definitely my favorite of the two as it was smaller, way more artsy, and more boutiquey. I splurged a bit and got the corner room with a colorful mural hand-painted by a local artist. And by splurged, I mean I spent $150/night for two nights. The room was huge, complete with two balconies overlooking the lively streets of Casco Viejo. It also has a bumping rooftop and lobby restaurant which I’ll talk about later.&nbsp;</p><h2>What I Did In Panama City, Panama</h2><p class="">The W pool (The Wet Deck) is currently my favorite rooftop pool ever. It had a very international vibe. And in fact, I met three other solo travelers from America and a group from England. They play hip music and serve craft cocktails and food all day. It turns into more of a party scene in the evening. This also may be the place to meet a man with financial means - or so I’ve heard.</p><p class=""><a href="https://ferrypearlislands.com/en/"><span>Isla Contadora</span></a>:<br>Visiting this island was one of those truly iconic moments that made me fall in love with traveling all over again. This was a true adventure, and I felt so free and in control of my life. I did an early morning excursion to Isla Contadora, a small island about an hour off the Pacific Coast. It was between this and Tobago, but Contadora was prettier in my opinion, and less developed. The only mistake I made, was that I didn’t rent a <a href="https://isladecontadora.com/en/package_category/golf-carts-mules"><span>golf cart</span></a>. But I did meet a local Afro-Panamaian who took me around the island and told me a bit about it. I ended up on Playa Larga, for my very first dip into the Pacific Ocean ever. The beach had at tops 20 people. At one point, I was the only person on this one section of the beach. Which was an actual dream of mine. But two things to know: you’re well outside of useful cell service, so download a map and bring cash. Also, the armed forces will check your bag when arriving or leaving. That was a fun surprise for me.&nbsp;</p><p class="">Panama Canal<br>Of course, the must-visit attraction in Panama is the Panama Canal. I didn’t realize how massive an undertaking the canal actually was. There is a short museum that takes you through how exactly the canal works and a tribute to the workers who built the canal. I had a full day planned, so I went during off-peak hours when there wasn’t a ship in port. I don’t recommend that. The canal is vastly more interesting when there is a ship moving through. You can check the canal’s website for daily scheduling.&nbsp;</p><p class="">Shopping in Casco Viejo<br>If you’re looking for souvenirs, this is the spot to travel to. You can find traditional handmade goods and the normal knick-knacks. If you are in search of an authentic Panama Hat, you however are in the wrong country. Ecuador actually makes what we know as Panama Hats. You can of course still buy imported ones. Check Victor’s for a great selection.</p><h2>Where I Ate In Panama City</h2><p class="">Diablicos Panama<br>This was recommended to me by a native Afro-Panamanian, and it was a very good meal with a mix of traditional Panamanian and Caribbean cuisines. The inside is colorfully decorated on the theme of its name. And even though it was in the mid-80s, I sat outside and took in to soak up all the sun before I traveled back to a snowy and cold Baltimore.</p><p class="">Taco La Neta<br>This is located on top of the Selina Hostel, a very hopping spot for international travelers. I sat at the bar and took in the Panamanian sunset. And even though, tacos aren’t native to Panama, the tacos and margs here are fabulous. You can totally stay the night to party, but I’m just a girl and I went home shortly after sunset. I didn’t feel unsafe, but it was my first international solo trip, so I thought it best that I get home before the street lights turn on.</p><p class="">Tantalo Restaurant <br>This restaurant was attached to my hotel and I absolutely love when I can just go downstairs to eat and drink. And all hotel restaurants are not made equal, this one was very lively and colorfully decorated. I found a quiet seat at the bar and had some of the best ceviche of my life here. I then headed to the rooftop for a quick drink. I think this was when I found out that I don’t like being in a crowd alone while solo traveling or not. I headed again to the quiet part of the rooftop and struck up a conversation with another American couple who gave me some food recommendations.</p><p class="">Casa Sucre Coffeehouse<br>This was a quiet traditional cafe located across the street from Tantalo. I had an authentic Panamanian chicken tamale for breakfast all wrapped up in a banana leaf. I still think about that tamale. It was so warm and savory and filling for the day.<br></p><p class="">Overall, I had a fantastic time in Panama. It was relatively inexpensive coming from the United States. While I stayed in at night mostly, I didn’t feel unsafe in the country at all. Everyone I talked to was friendly even if there was a language barrier. Probably the most shocking thing to me was the amount of black people I encountered. Starting in the airport, people spoke to me in Spanish assuming I was a local and I think that made me feel a bit safer.</p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/57d9640dbe659412f369f64f/1712012626620-CEHP7TG2UYB87CICZKJ2/image-asset.jpeg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="1125"><media:title type="plain">My Panama City Itinerary</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Blue Lagoon vs. Sky Lagoon: Which One is Better?</title><dc:creator>Antoinette Childs</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 15 Apr 2024 01:04:12 +0000</pubDate><link>https://thefancyfriend.com/travel-blog/2024/3/28/blue-lagoon-vs-sky-lagoon-which-one-is-better</link><guid isPermaLink="false">57d9640dbe659412f369f64f:66059c00fa3b4f6507086bdf:66062cfb36306003b6a9b25a</guid><description><![CDATA[<p class="">“Bathing” or swimming culture throughout Iceland is one of the reasons I love to visit Iceland. It revolves around socializing in heated pools or lagoons. The most popular one is of course The Blue Lagoon. But a newcomer, Sky Lagoon, is starting to come up the tourist circles, especially with recent seismic activity near the Blue Lagoon. I have been to both twice and here are my thoughts if you are trying to decide which one to visit.<br><br></p><h2>Blue Lagoon</h2>

  <p class="">Obviously, the Blue Lagoon is iconic. There are hot springs and lagoons around the world, but the naturally occurring blue color is one of a kind, produced by the silica and algae in water. But is it the best lagoon to visit in Iceland?<br></p><p class="">Pros:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">The Blue Lagoon is an iconic world wonder. You can’t find naturally occurring water like this anywhere else in the world.</p></li><li><p class="">The face masks they offer are a nice experience. The Blue Lagoon produces a skincare line that you can sample while relaxing in the pool. They left my skin feeling wonderful</p></li><li><p class="">The swim-up bar is very handy. They have a delicious green juice option and other alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverage selections as well as water stations throughout the lagoon.</p></li><li><p class="">The dining options are fabulous. The Blue Lagoon has a casual eatery as well as two fine-dining restaurants on the property all with absolutely stunning views.</p></li><li><p class="">You can stay at the Blue Lagoon - for a price. The Blue Lagoon also houses two on site hotels, The Silica and The Retreat.</p></li><li><p class="">They offer truly relaxing spa services. Where else can you get an in-water massage?!</p></li></ul><p class="">Cons:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">You have to be careful with your hair. The silica in the water can dry out and harden your hair. You need to coat it in conditioner (which is provided) and try to keep it as dry as possible.</p></li><li><p class="">You can’t see through the water. I dropped my sunglasses and had a hard time trying to fish them out.</p></li><li><p class="">It’s a little bit away from Reyvavik. The Blue Lagoon does offer shuttles to and from the lagoon but it’s about 45 minutes away.</p></li></ul><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><h2>Sky Lagoon</h2>

  <p class="">Sky Lagoon is a newcomer tourism attraction, closer to Reyvavik. With the addition of shuttle buses from the capital city, it is even easier to access the beautiful landscape views that Sky Lagoon offers. But with all of that, is it worth skipping the Blue Lagoon?</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><p class="">Pros:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Sky Lagoon offers private changing rooms. Icelandic rules require you to shower naked before getting in the lagoon. Sky Lagoon has private shower stalls, but here you can pay for a private changing room if you don’t want to change and shower in front of everyone.</p></li><li><p class="">They also have swimsuit rentals for a low price. You can rent a swimsuit if you forget like me. Plus sizes included.</p></li><li><p class="">The seven-step skincare routine is a lot of fun. You can pay for a seven-step skincare ritual which includes additional cool plunges and sauna access (pictured above).</p></li><li><p class="">They have crystal clear blue-green water. You can actually see through the water and can get your hair wet without damage.</p></li><li><p class="">The location is better for those staying in Reyvavik. Sky Lagoon is much closer to Reyvavik and they run shuttles as well.</p></li><li><p class="">The views are spectacular. The edge of the lagoon is an infinity pool with amazing views of mountain ranges and the Atlantic Ocean.</p></li></ul><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><p class="">Cons:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">They have fewer dining options. They have a cafe and a casual eatery but not a full-service restaurant certainly not Michelin-star cuisine.</p></li><li><p class="">They don’t accept Apple Pay. They are one of the few places in Iceland that don't accept Apple Pay. It was more annoying than anything.</p></li></ul><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><h2>My Decision</h2><p class="">My advice would be to try to go to both. They are both different experiences and I don’t think either completely outweighs the other. But… if you are limited to one… my choice is The Blue Lagoon. You can get hot springs, thermal baths, etc. elsewhere in the world, but not the “blue” nature of the blue lagoon. And if you want to dive more into authentic Icelandic culture, you can visit one of Iceland’s local lagoons as well.</p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/57d9640dbe659412f369f64f/1713143096658-6GHO96Z6KMR6SNQ1H6BB/image-asset.jpeg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="1000"><media:title type="plain">Blue Lagoon vs. Sky Lagoon: Which One is Better?</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>How To Spend 24 Hours In Iceland</title><category>Travel</category><category>Boutique Hotel</category><category>itineraries</category><dc:creator>Antoinette Childs</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 01 Apr 2024 00:54:07 +0000</pubDate><link>https://thefancyfriend.com/travel-blog/2024/3/31/how-to-spend-24-hours-in-iceland</link><guid isPermaLink="false">57d9640dbe659412f369f64f:66059c00fa3b4f6507086bdf:660a05b404b19e128d961495</guid><description><![CDATA[<p class="">On my way back from Paris in the summer of 2023, I was able to snag a 24-hour layover in Iceland. These extended layover stops are referred to as stopovers. Several airlines around the world offer them and it’s a great way to fit an extra city or country into your trip without paying for a separate flight. Some airlines even offer free accommodations or tours. However, I was flying on Play Airlines, a low-cost Icelandic airlines. So I had to make my own accommodations, but no worries. I had a great time during my 24-hour trip to Iceland. Here’s what I did:</p><p class="">2 pm: I landed with my carry-on while my main luggage was checked to my final destination. After clearing customs, I then took a shuttle to the rental car lot and picked up my car. And would you believe this was actually the first time I’ve ever rented a car! At 31! Shoutout to my travel credit card that has rental car insurance included. Iceland drives on the same side of the road as the US so adjusting was easy.&nbsp;</p><p class="">4 pm: I arrive at my beautiful boutique hotel, <a href="https://www.hotelberg.is/en/" target="_blank">Hotel Berg</a>, about 10 minutes from the airport. I settled in a bit and then headed to <a href="https://www.skylagoon.com/packages/" target="_blank">Sky Lagoon</a> about 45 minutes away. In my rush, I left my swimsuit behind, but luckily they have swimsuit rentals for $7, plus sizes included!</p><p class="">6 pm: I love the “bathing” culture in Iceland. Please just let me soak in a heated pool every time I’m stressed. Because of this love, I prioritized going back to the Blue Lagoon and Sky Lagoon. Sky Lagoon is the new kid on the block as far as tourist lagoons. The water is warm and clear, perfect for this stormy and slightly cold day. But my favorite part is the views of the harbor even in cloudy weather. I went for the lite package and just unwinded for a few hours with a glass of champagne.</p><p class="">9 pm: Still exhausted I arrived back at the hotel restaurant; <a href="https://www.hotelberg.is/en/restaurant.html" target="_blank">Fiskbarrin</a>. I had some interesting Icelandic cuisine and another glass of champagne. Can you blame me?! Champagne is so much cheaper in Europe.</p><p class="">10:30 pm: Still jetlagged and travel tired, I put on my eye mask and go to sleep. Summer in Iceland means the sun doesn’t set so a proper eye mask is a must for sleeping.</p><p class="">~~~~</p><p class="">8 am: I get up and munch on some chips before heading to the Blue Lagoon for a morning dip. The hotel did offer breakfast, but I was too busy to stop.</p><p class="">9 am: After a 15-minute or so drive, I arrive at the <a href="https://www.bluelagoon.com/" target="_blank">Blue Lagoon.</a> It’s such a relaxing time before getting on my 6-hour flight home. I got an amazing green juice this morning. time to detox from all the champagne.</p><p class="">10:30 am: I stayed just a bit too long just relaxing in the pool. I called my hotel to make sure I could get a late checkout. No problem.&nbsp;</p><p class="">12 pm: After a lovely shower (Iceland has the most beautiful naturally occurring soft water), I finally check out a bit late and go for a walk on the trail behind the hotel. It was very windy and slightly rainy, but it was so gorgeous. Sometimes when I’m at home, I dream about walking along that trail. Iceland is such a peaceful place for me.</p><p class="">12:30 pm: I fill up my car and drop it back off with no issue. Then I ride the shuttle bus back to the Keflavik airport. I got a traditional Scandinavian shrimp sandwich and settled in a bit before my flight. And thanks to my AirTag, I saw my bag was safe and sound after 24 hours.</p><p class="">3:05 pm: After chilling in the airport for a while (yes I’m a get to the airport EARLY kind of gal), I’m on my way back home after 25 hours in Iceland.</p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/57d9640dbe659412f369f64f/1711933657652-6Q78H9FWXI14I3XUMYK0/image-asset.jpeg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="1000"><media:title type="plain">How To Spend 24 Hours In Iceland</media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
